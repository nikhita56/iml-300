# Project 3 explanation-This website details child marriage in india or the "child bride" syndrome as it's commonly known. It is popular in rural Asian villages, India in this case, to marry their girls extremely young for financial, cultural, or social reasons. These girls often end up in abusive or immature relationships leading to domestic violence or too many children and reproductive issues. This topic has a heavy stigma around it that these parents should know better or that is isn't as common as it is but this website just provides more info and awareness to the fact that women have a voice too and these girls have been failed by an entire world. So my website is designed to capture both the fun spirit of childhood wonder but also the stark reality that is so many young girls lives.
