    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <h2>Week 1:</h2>

    <p>When reading the first article on the history of female involvement in digital and computer art, I was interested in the hidden levels women reached in these early times. Although I never doubted a female's ability to contribute to these fields, I was admittedly shocked that I had never heard of such involvement in any computer based field. The feeling of wiping women from history only perpetuates implicit bias against women when it comes to the modern day and age. The artist I read about that stood out the most to me was Leslie Mezei. She made the claim that computer art has become stagnant in its growth. It caused me to wonder about the real implications of art and how deep the human perspective goes when considering how much meaning to apply to something.
        <br>
        <br>
        Questions:
        Although the early years did not see high gender stratification compared to other male dominated STEAM fields, why was the history of computer art, and really anything to do with computers, largely wiped of female involvement in most historical contexts?
        A lot of computer art in the eyes of many has stalled and become stagnant in both ideas and interest. Where do we see the future of computer art going, what do we see it potentially evolving into?
        Ken Knowlton brought up the question of whether or not computer art defines a wholly new category of art. I want to dive deeper and ask for the implications of such an idea being deemed true?
    </p>
    <h2>Week 2: </h2>

    <p>I found it extremely interesting that creativity came at the price of economic freedom. I never understood and continue to not understand why creativity does not offer as much as strict analytical thinking. Moving on to the idea of “blackness” and the black gooey, I found the end of the article particularly interesting in its final question: for who? I’ve always seen black as all color and whire as the absence of color, and in such thinking looked at white as a blueprint when really, black was the blueprint. This thinking resonated with me when I read the lines “Blackness has, so to say, formed the ground for white, with black gooey being antithetical to the values of the white screen.” Building on this idea, the writer claimed that the black gooey did not go along with the values of a white screen. It reminded me of the use of race in film, particularly stereotypes of different races being used to brainwash a majority white audience with these characters being created solely to push values of white dominance onto impressionable audiences.
        <br>
        <br>
        Questions:
        If cis-white men dominated early forms of interfaces, where did the stereotype of Asians and other races being delegated to those fields come from and why did it stick?
        How can users work together to destabilize such values?
        How will color continue to impact Silicon Valley and those who work within it?

    </p>
    <h2>Week 3:</h2>

    <p>In this week’s article, the author described her early joy and wonder at the discovery of the internet. She found it particularly alluring due to its ability to diversify human connection. Considering the internet was described as “a portal to an entirely different world”, she used it to explore what else was out there. As Professor notes in her lecture, the internet was originally used as a military weapon, one intended to protect the military from attacks to its command and controls. Together, it is clear that the internet has become unrecognizable from what it was originally created to do. Although our lives have become arguably easier and more enriched because of this new technology, we have also become distant and shut inside our screens. We are not able to see other viewpoints or opinions because we’re shown exactly what we want to see. Going forward, how will we begin to return to the original goals of what the internet could be?
        <br>
        <br>
        Questions:
        The author claims that people used to like the internet for its new connection to other people, what do you think they would say now about the obvious social disconnect newer generations have solely because of the internet?
        Building off my previous question, this author discusses the exciting `realness” and beauty centered around shared images and ideas not being beautiful at all. Do you think that so-called realness and beauty has been completely sacrificed by apps like Snapchat or Instagram, if so, is there a way to get it back?
        Like Professor discusesses, how has the internet changed from a defense to a weapon like the current cyber attacks now becoming more normalized in war?
    </p>
    <h2>Week 4:</h2>

    <p>I was very intrigued by the idea of the “poor image” in my mind that was more the fragment of an idea, something that never made it to production or full thought. In reality, I was interested that the way poor images became poor images was through the commercialization of media and in that occurring, anything that was actually considered art became more or less something underground. I also found it interesting that in the hidden articulation these pieces became “poor images” because their value was essentially taken away and replaced with something less genuine and avant-garde to consumers. It was the displacement of such work that took away its real meaning.
        <br>
        <br>
        Questions:
        What does the future of “poor images” look like as art moves into a more digital age, and in doing so an era capable of storing everything?
        Is it possible for the commercialized images that circulate today to become like poor images as society continues to replace what it builds?
        How has the privatization of these images changed how these images are viewed not necessarily in terms of value, but in terms of artistic power?
    </p>
    <h2>Week 5:</h2>

    <p>The entire idea of algorithmic bias is intriguing partially because it is entirely expected and also because with something as objective as code, completely unexpected. Because you can input a set of faces and including a diverse group seems rather simple to my mind but also I understand how implicit bias can affect this. To me, the problem is that a lot of objective code is controlled by unobjective people. The importance of facial recognition software hinges on a broad inclusion of the audience, in other words there is no room for bias when creating for a market where race is not something that should affect who buys what software.
        <br>
        <br>
        Questions:
        Has algorithmic bias increased as technology becomes more fine tuned and evolves or has it been decreasing?
        How does algorithmic bias affect industries that rely on tech, but aren’t fully immersed such as polling or election material?
        What would make facial recognition more accurate in the public security sector?
    </p>
    <h2>Week 6:</h2>

    <p>A lot of us are in CTCS 150 right now and the idea of implicit bias was something we happened to discuss this week. This idea was what this TED talk reminded me of strongly. One form of bias is called affinity bias where a person uses one trait to decide how they feel about an entire person or concept. The “one story” approach discussed here is very similar to that. Although we’re constantly taught to keep an open mind and be understanding of different people around us. Phrases like “there’s people starving in Africa” while mostly tend to be well-meaning are derogatory and ignorant but because that one narrative defines the majority of races in some form, we develop implicit biases until we don’t understand why we think the way we do. The speaker brought up how she herself was guilty of this when looking at one of her house attendants and she didn’t understand how a lack of money translated to talent until she thought back about her assertion. This talk was very interesting and forced me to consider the stories I’ve been told as well as how those influence the stories I create today.
        <br>
        <br>
        Questions:
        Why do we assert terms like “poor” with “untalented”, and why is it so hard to recognize these thoughts?
        How do we challenge stereotypes in our work without drawing more attention and in some form validation to those stories?
        How do we fully combat implicit bias?
    </p>
    <h2>Week 7:</h2>

    <p>My favorite part of this presentation was when Ari discussed the capitalistic side to technology, the ways in which technology has the capability to make people extremely wealthy, but it's just a few and the rest are left with destroyed lives over the negative effects of it. It reminded me of several interviews that CEOs of social media and tech companies do where they say they will never let their child use Instagram or Snapchat or whatever is it their company is responsible for, yet they have no problem marketing to the general public. Further, Ari discusses the “mythology of technology” where it is said that technology takes away from our inherent ability to create sustainable things which I also found enlightening and correct in my mind.
        <br>
        <br>
        Questions:
        What are the lengths art can go to tell, are there limitations on how much art can do?
        How do we make technology more inclusive for marginalized communities?
        How do we make technology more sustainable, are there limits to its sustainability?
