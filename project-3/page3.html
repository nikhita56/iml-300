            they got me engaged."We shouldn’t get

            married to our uncles. I told my mother that
            <br>and she would scold and hit me; she also burnt
            <br>
            my hands a few times, assuming I am in love with

            someone else,” she said.

        A patriarchal mind-set is one of the main reasons for most child marriages
        <br> in India: young girls, and women 
        in general are perceived to be natural homemakers. 
        <br>
        Their lives are to be limited within the four walls, as they 
        are unqualified to 
        <br>
        protect themselves from the dangerous world outside. They need not be educated,
        <br>
         nor 
        employed, as they are born to serve and care for the men in the family. When young
        <br>
         and unmarried, they are 
        a liability that must be prevented from doing ‘unwomanly’ acts, to 
        <br>
        avoid bringing shame upon the community. 
        Hence, they must be married off young to withhold
        <br>
         family honour, sometimes even to men twice their age. 
        This heinous practice has notably has caused
        <br>
         deaths in married girls aged 15-19 due to premature pregnancies. 
        The girls run the risk of 
        <br>
        contracting HIV, and their children, if born, suffer from low immunity,many of them dying in infancy. 
        <br>
        Several girls, in such a condition, are exposed to sexual abuse, and suffer from post-traumatic stress.
