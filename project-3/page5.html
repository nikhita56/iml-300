     Saba was married at the age of 17, after she was
     <br>
      “sexually abused” by her “second cousin”. “When
      <br>
       I shared this with my parents, they refused to 
       <br>
       believe me. It started when I was six or seven years 
       <br>
       old, and when my parents got to know, they did not take it
       <br>
        well.” She met a guy at the age of 17, who claimed he
        <br>
         wanted to end her childhood suffering. But, she realised
         <br>
          within a year of marriage that she had not made the
          <br>
           right decision.

 In another account in the remote village of Doodiya in Madhya Pradesh, 11-year-old and 
 <br>
 already married Nikita said, “My uncle’s daughter got married when she turned 5. In fact, I am late.”
And those stories aren’t unique, in fact 
<br>
it is shared by 1.5 million girls in India. As per UNICEF reports, on an average, 27% of girl children in India are married off before their 18th birthday, 7% by the time they are 15. Be it child marriage, education, employment, or the exercise of fundamental rights, India is still lagging behind in gender equality. One may wonder, why, in spite of regulations like The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, India ranks the highest in the world in the number of child marriages? To answer that, one has to delve deep into the socio-political and economic structure harboured by the country.
